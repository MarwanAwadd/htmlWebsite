    <h1>My Favourite Video Games</h1>
    <h2>These are my favourite video games (in no particular order):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Marvel's Spiderman</h4>
            <img src="../images/spiderman.jpeg" alt="Spiderman" title="Spiderman" height="200">
            <p>The spiderman game, although a bit short, may be one of the most<br>well rounded games I have ever played as it has fun gameplay,<br>an emotional story and potential for expansion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Horizon Zero Dawn</h4>
            <img src="../images/horizon.jpeg" alt="Horizon Zero Dawn" title="Horizon Zero Dawn">
            <p>Although the story is a little lackluster, this game has one of the<br>most creative combat systems ever with almost limitless<br> potential for tactics.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Bloodborne</h4>
            <img src="../images/bloodborne.jpeg" alt="Bloodborne" title="Bloodborne" width="300">
            <p>The game is a very challenging game with alot of potential character<br>builds but also so much fun yet so painful as when you die, you<br>restart from specific points and must repeat all you have done<br> to regain your lost points.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</h4>
            <img src="../images/acv.jpeg" alt="Assassins Creed Brotherhood" title="Assassins Creed Brotherhood">
            <p>To me, this game is the pinnacle of an iconic game series and the game<br>that started me on the path of gaming in the first place which is<br>why I love it. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>God Of War</h4>
            <img src="../images/gow.jpeg" alt="God Of War" title="God Of War">
            <p>A continuation to an iconic series, this game also masters every element<br>in a game from a thrilling story, great character development and<br>the gameplay is just phenomenal. I'm also a fan of norse mythology.</p>
        </li>
