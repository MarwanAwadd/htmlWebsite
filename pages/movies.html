            <img src="../images/interstellar.jpeg" alt="Interstellar" title="Interstellar">
            <p>My love for this movie comes from how much time and effort they put<br>into making it accurate to current theories in<br>scientific communities and still having an amazing story.</p>

            <h4>Spiderman: No Way Home</h4>
            <img src="../images/spidermanbwh.jpeg" alt="Spiderman NWH" title="Spiderman NWH">
            <p>I was always a huge spiderman fan as a child and this movie was the<br>highlight of my year when it came out as it brought back the older<br> actors in a story that was enjoyable and just wow.</p>
